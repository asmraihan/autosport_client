                üî¥ What is JWT? JWT stands for ‚Äú JSON web token ‚Äù it is an open
                  standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way
                  for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON
                  object. JWT is simply a token that is written in JSON format. It is
                  really safe to use because it can be signed in using a secret (with
                  the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
                  üî¥How does JWT work? JWT contains 3 parts 1) The header 2) The
                  payload 3) The signature image The header of the JWT token is just
                  some metadata for the token such as the algorithm name and type.
                  image The payload is some data that you can encode into the jwt
                  which will be saved in the token payload and later you can use those
                  unique data to identify the specific user. The more data you add the
                  bigger the jwt token will be.
